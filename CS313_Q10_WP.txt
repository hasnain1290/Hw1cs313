Q10) create a linked list and fill with numbers 1 to k,then create a function that
sorts the list so that first all odd numbers are listed and then all even numbers.
Some conditions that were taken by the question:
1. create linked list
2. fill with numbers
3. create a sort function

addlist function: function in which when 
called will take the inputted number and insert
it after the head node which is a nullptr

printlist function : the generic function of printing a linked list from couting
the info and then continuing on to the next node via current=current->link

changeEvenToOdd: function that works multiple checks to make sure
that the odd number of elements are moved to the back and in the same order
and then checks to make sure those even nodes are push to the front in the
same order

Main: initiated a linked list and filled it with 10 numbers 1-10 and
then print out the list when the list is printed the next function is
the changeEventoOdd function which would switch around the nodes from
the beginning becoming even nodes and the ending become odd nodes, then
proceed to print out the same list after the function is processed and 
show the changing of the even to odd nodes
