Create a sort for 2d matrices.Do a bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort
variation of this.

For sorting in the 2d matices, we need to pay attention to the indexing. 
Let say we have a 2d matrix with i rows and j column.
When we traverse from one row to its second row, i needs to starting from 0, j only needs to plus 1.
To solve the problem, we use the following strategy:
Given a matrix[3][3] = {{0,1,2},{3,4,5},{6,7,8}}
Known 5 is the 5th element in the matrix.(starting from index 0)
5 / row_size ==> 5/3 = 1 
5 mod row_size ==> 5 mod 3 = 2
matrix[1][2] --> the indexing of 5 in the matrix
