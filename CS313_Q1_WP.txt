//1. 

Test whether a vector or a list is faster by timing them via :
a.Filling them with random numbers
b.Filling them with random strings(use ascii)
c.Doing the above with move semantics when filling with random strings

The build functions will fill vector and list random int and string. 
when filling strings, we use generate_string() to generate lowercase string with random size.
In Q1_main(), we time the speed of buildVector() and buildList() using "Timing.cpp"
